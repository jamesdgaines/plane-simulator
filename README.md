# 3D Plane Simulator - UFO Defense

A browser-based 3D plane game where you pilot an aircraft to defend a city from hovering UFOs using Three.js.

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Graphics card with WebGL 2.0 support
- Keyboard for controls

### Functional Requirements
- 3D plane model with realistic movement
- Urban city environment as battlefield
- Intuitive plane controls (keyboard-based)
- UFO enemies with hover patterns
- Shooting mechanics with projectiles
- Explosion effects for destroyed targets
- Audio system (music and sound effects)
- Game states: Start screen, gameplay, victory, and game over screens
- Score tracking system

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Game logic and interactions
- **HTML5** - Canvas and DOM structure
- **CSS3** - UI styling and responsive design

### Additional Libraries
- **Three.js Loaders** - 3D model loading (GLTFLoader, OBJLoader)
- **Cannon.js** or **Ammo.js** - Physics engine (if needed)
- **Web Audio API** - Sound effects and music playback

### Development Tools
- **Vite** or **Webpack** - Build tool and development server
- **Node.js** - Package management
- **Git** - Version control

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Create Plane Model
- [ ] Design or import 3D plane model
- [ ] Set up basic Three.js scene with camera and lighting
- [ ] Render plane model in 3D space
- [ ] Implement basic plane animations (propeller rotation, etc.)
- [ ] Test model loading and rendering performance

### Milestone 2: Build City Environment
- [ ] Create urban landscape with buildings
- [ ] Add ground terrain and skybox
- [ ] Implement environmental lighting (day/night cycle optional)
- [ ] Optimize city rendering for performance
- [ ] Add atmospheric effects (fog, clouds)

### Milestone 3: Set Up Plane Controls
- [ ] Implement keyboard input handling
- [ ] Create plane movement mechanics (pitch, yaw, roll)
- [ ] Add camera following system
- [ ] Fine-tune flight physics and controls
- [ ] Add HUD elements (speed, altitude, crosshair)

### Milestone 4: Add UFOs, Shooting, and Explosions
- [ ] Create UFO enemy models and behaviors
- [ ] Implement UFO spawning and hover patterns
- [ ] Add shooting mechanics and projectile system
- [ ] Create collision detection between projectiles and UFOs
- [ ] Design explosion effects and particle systems
- [ ] Implement scoring and enemy destruction logic

### Milestone 5: Add Audio and Game Screens
- [ ] Integrate background music and sound effects
- [ ] Create start screen with game instructions
- [ ] Implement victory screen with score display
- [ ] Add game over screen with restart option
- [ ] Polish UI elements and transitions
- [ ] Final testing and performance optimization
